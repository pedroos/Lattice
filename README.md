# Gelosia algorithm
An algorithm for big integer multiplication.

The lattice or gelosia method here implemented is an ancient multiplication method with the idea that numbers can be multiplied digit-by-digit and, as each digit only ranges from 0 to 9, the maximum multiplication performed per step is 9 x 9.
